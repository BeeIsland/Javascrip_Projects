# Javascript Projects

This is where I store most of my Javascript work

It also contains 4 projects that are more complete than the rest, those being:

*Pizza Project
*Calculator
*Tic-Tac-Toe
*Portfolio Project

**Pizza Project**
The Pizza project is a website containing checkboxes to order pizza.
The website looks pretty simple, and it calculates the price the pizza you make.


**Calculator**
This is just what it sounds like, a web app that crunches numbers.

**Tic-Tac-Toe**
This one is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe played against an AI that moves at random.
It includes sound effects and visuals to theem it to halloween.

**Portfolio Project**
This project didn't start in this repository, and the old version is still stored in HTML and CSS repository.
This is an update to my portfolio website that adds functionality and new features using javascript.
The new features include a pop-up contact form and a slideshow. In my humble opinion, the website looks fantastic.
