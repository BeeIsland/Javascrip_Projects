# Javascript Projects <br>

This is where I store most of my Javascript work <br>

It also contains 4 projects that are more complete than the rest, those being: <br>

*Pizza Project <br>
*Calculator <br>
*Tic-Tac-Toe <br>
*Portfolio Project <br>

**Pizza Project** <br>
The Pizza project is a website containing checkboxes to order pizza. <br>
The website looks pretty simple, and it calculates the price the pizza you make. <br>


**Calculator** <br>
This is just what it sounds like, a web app that crunches numbers. <br>

**Tic-Tac-Toe** <br>
This one is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe played against an AI that moves at random. <br>
It includes sound effects and visuals to theem it to halloween. <br>

**Portfolio Project** <br>
This project didn't start in this repository, and the old version is still stored in HTML and CSS repository. <br>
This is an update to my portfolio website that adds functionality and new features using javascript. <br>
The new features include a pop-up contact form and a slideshow. In my humble opinion, the website looks fantastic. <br>
